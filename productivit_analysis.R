# A randomized controlled trial compared 12 different variants 
# of a goal setting app to a control condition that did wasnâ€™t 
# given the goal setting app. The researcher recruited 50 participants 
# per condition and used RescueTime to obtain a productivity score
# for each participant. The resulting data are contained 
# in the attached csv file. How would you interpret these results?

# I would assume researchers assigned either first or last column for control.
# X81: mean 91.59, std 28.6068 mean p: 0.5636
# X74: mean 87.76, std 33.7027 mean p: 0.3517
# Neither X81 nor X74 are statistically different with respect to any columns.
# I conclude that X74 is most probably the control.

# with respect to x81, x95 has lowest p value -> 0.0427
# with respect to x74, x95 has lowest p value -> 0.0122
# I looked into x95. It has mean p of 0.1086 wrt everything else.
# has significant p values wrt four other columns. 
# has highest mean at 102. second lowest std at 26.80.
# four confidence intervals that do not allow for 0.
